If the occlusion (bite) is misaligned, then it could possibly create “ill-effects throughout many distant areas of the united body,” says <a href="http://mitchmarderdds.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-dental-distress-syndrome-quantified.pdf ">Dr. A.C. Fonder</a>. This dysfunction is also known as Dental Distress Syndrome (DDS).</p>
<p><strong>What is DDS?</strong> Similar to the above statement, DDS is the dysfunctioning occlusion that can negatively affect over 50% of the body’s function. When the bite is in distress, it sends erroneous feedback to the brain, which can negatively impact sensory controls, reduce blood supply to the brain, and reduce electrical signals to the brain. This can upset your body’s normal functions, which directly impacts your overall health.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>What causes DDS?</strong>   There are a number of reasons that can upset the alignment of your jaw. Some of those reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The loss of teeth</li>
<li>Misalignment of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)</li>
<li>Excessive wear on the teeth</li>
<li>Underdeveloped upper jaw</li>
<li>Traumatic injuries to the jaw</li>
</ul>
<p>This disruption to the jaw can result into DDS if not treated. As a result, your muscles begin to tighten, limiting blood flow to your brain. How? Blood goes to and from the brain through 68 pairs of dental muscles, and when they tighten, the blood flow is significantly reduced.</p>
<p><strong>What are the symptoms of DDS?</strong> There are multiple symptoms that could directly indicate you have DDS. Some of those symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tenderness around the TMJ area</li>
<li>Limited flexibility of opening and closing the mouth</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can Dr. Mitch Marder help?</strong> While the advanced stages of DDS need to be consulted with a medical doctor and your dentist, Dr. Marder can help prevent your symptoms from worsening and realign your jaw joint with his <a href=" http://mitchmarderdds.com/tmj-seattle-treatment">TMJ treatment</a>.</p>
